default attribute on load, also "all users" thing


attributes
  i want current attribute to get bounced back(no schema), i want attributecounts (schema)
user selection (can select multiple?)

pair chosing? (just do random and random)

some elo is getting sucked up right now, IDK

asses
  (probably get more actions to work..)

get more actions to work
add item. use the forms thing?? no, use existing thing.

refactor to use component system...

attributes, must fit in frequencies/counts into gql schema somehow... (could hack, put into string as last two characters...


permissions/schemas.... (after all actions are done..., and one pass over of cleaning)

fix
  upsert on pair already inserted...


fix frontend until it has parity, then host, THEN do performance.
  PROBLEM: the (xt/db that everyone is using is actually frozen in time, so it wont have the right keys)

  do 20 minutes of performacne stuff, the go home

  attribute selection
  user selection
  



look into performance, ask on zulip before giving up.
 ask: use criterium to compare things on xtdb, compare to postgres
  use synthetic benchmark

get attributes rendering.
get pair rendering



make baseline render properly/fix issues
start adding in important mutations
permissions/schema
add move button
deploy (start using).
integrate with discord api.

switch to faster vector library

eventually make url sync with user/attribute parameters
