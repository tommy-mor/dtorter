make gql support pair chosing
get full aplication db running from just internally run gql query
get spec validation for re-frame db
make initial state render fully from that  (don't touch network requests)


merge front and backend codebases...
  * put gql query from tag.clj into cljc file..
  * specs apply both places
  

make init db come from gql client
make client use gql in re-frame events
then actions
add unsorted gql attribute

go to party
