:sorter.impl/todo
  do tag page (finish today...)
  do add item form...

  pair chosing? (just do random and random)

  some elo is getting sucked up right now, IDK

  permissions/schemas.... (after all actions are done..., and one pass over of cleaning)

  switch to faster vector library
  eventually make url sync with user/attribute parameters

  design: put the parent tag as a vertical text skinny box to left of item panel.
